SSL_RRPCA is the cleanest RRPCA code. RRPCA SDT is one that I used, as well as fixing sparse. organizing matrices is used as well in SSL. 

Timeseries code includes: Plotting Timeseries data.R, plot_diel_presence.Exporting_to_R also used for this.

All gmt code and sitemap.m is to create sitemap.

Cluster_quality_metrics to create Cluster plots. ConcatTypes 4 plot as well

Precision_recall to calculate those metrics.
